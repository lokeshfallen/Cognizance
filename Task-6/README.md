#### _Theme_

#### _Motivation_
* This seemed to be a unique topic :grey_exclamation:. Making a landing page in this topic would be more professional.
* Also, I would get lots of reference since there are lots of plugins which are of the same interest.

#### _Future Improvements_
* The buttons in the landing page will be made more interactive.
* example: 
  <br>
  
While Not Hovering | While Hovering|
---|---
<img src = "img/cog_1.png" width = 150 > | <img src = img/cog_2.png width = 150>

* More  Webpages will be created that will be linked with the Landing/Home page.
